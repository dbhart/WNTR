.. _whatsnew_0150:

v0.1.5 (Master branch)
---------------------------------------------------

* Replaced the use of Pandas Panels with a dictionary of Pandas DataFrames (Pandas is deprecating Panels).
  This changes the way users interact with simulation results.
  
  * Removed 'expected_demand' and 'type' from simulation results.  Expected demand can be computed using :class:`~wntr.metrics.hydraulic.expected_demand`.
  * Removed simulation_results example, example is now embedded in the documentation
  
* Updated metrics to use simulation results in the new format and to clarify names.  

  * Input arguments are now more explicit, e.g. pass a DataFrame with junction demands instead of an entire Panel.
  
  * Updated the following metric names: changed fdv to water_service_availability,
    todini to todini_index, cost to annual_network_cost, ghg_emissions to annual_ghg_emissions
  
  * Removed the following metrics: fdd and fdq, these can be computed with simple queries.

* Improved error messages when simulation does not converge
* Updated default options for the WNTRSimulator
* Bug fix in node registries for the use of patterns
* Changed default colormap from jet to Spectral_r
* Updated documentation
