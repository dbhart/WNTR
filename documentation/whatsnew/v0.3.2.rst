v0.3.2 (main branch)
---------------------------------------------------

* Updated the results object

  * Added ``setting`` to the WNTRSimulator results link DataFrame
  * Added methods on the results object to run basic computation such as add, subtract, divide, power, and abs

* Added slots to water network model options, ``wn.options``, to define available option names.
  This update helps eliminate the use of incorrect or deprecated options.
  The user can still create custom options under ``wn.options.user``. 

* Removed custom handlers from the EPANET bin filer reader.  

* Changed the following network component attributes:
  
  * Pipe ``check_valve_flag`` and ``cv`` attributes were merged and renamed ``check_valve``
  * Pipe, Valve, and Pump ``status`` now refers to the current simulation status and is read-only, the user can set the initial status using ``initial_status``
  * Valve ``setting`` now refers to the current simulation setting and is read-only, the user can set the initial setting using ``initial_setting``
 
* Added a metric to compute pump energy

* Added type checking for input into `wn.add_*` methods.

* Updated the WNTRSimulator to use `wn.options.time.start_clocktime`.

* Updated documentation example that creates a weighted graph.

* Updated all tests to use unittest. Removed Travis CI testing framework, all tests are run through GitHub Actions.
