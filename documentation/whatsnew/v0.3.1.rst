v0.3.1 (dev branch)
---------------------------------------------------

* The `run_sim` method for the EpanetSimulator now includes the option to define convergence error behavior.
  
  * If the simulation does not converge and `convergence_error` is True, an error is raised. 
  * If the simulation does not converge and `convergence_error` is False, partial results are returned, a warning is issued, and results object `error_code` is set to 0.
  
  The default setting for `convergence_error` when using the EpanetSimulator is False.
  
* The default setting for `convergence_error` in the WNTRSimulator was changed to False.
