v0.1.4 (Master branch)
---------------------------------------------------

* Added a faster EPANET binary output file reader
* Added ability to get the names of all required objects that are queried or acted upon by the control (see :class:`~wntr.network.controls.Control.requires`)
* Modified the structure of the WaterNetworkOptions object to group options into types (API change, see :class:`~wntr.network.options.WaterNetworkOptions`)
* Created a Pattern object that can be called to get the pattern value at a specific time (see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.Pattern`)
* Created a TimeSeries object that contains a base value, Pattern object, and category.  The object can be called to get its value at a specific time.
  TimeSeries are used to store junction demand, source injection, pricing, pump speed, and reservoir head. (see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.TimeSeries`)
* Created a Demands object that contains multiple demands for a single junction and can 
  calculate demand values at a specific time.  The ability to store multiple demands per junction means that
  'base_demand' is no longer a Junction attribute (API change). The Demands object can be used to extract the base value per demand.  
  Expected demand and average daily expected demand can also be calculated using new metrics (see :class:`~wntr.metrics.hydraulic.expected_demand` and :class:`~wntr.metrics.hydraulic.average_expected_demand`).
* Added support for flow control valves (FCV), multiple demands at a junction, and variable reservoir head in the WNTRSimulator
* Modified the WaterNetworkModel.add_pattern() to no longer accept start_time and end_time options.  
  Binary patterns can be created using the Patterns object (API change, see :class:`~wntr.network.elements.Pattern.binary_pattern`).
