.. _whatsnew_0220:

v0.2.2 (master)
---------------------------------------------------

* Updated methods that use NetworkX to be compatible with NetworkX 2.4
* `WntrMultiDiGraph` class has been removed and WNTR uses the NetworkX `MultiDiGraph` class directly.  
  Methods associated with WntrMultiDiGraph have been relocated (API change).

  * `wn.get_graph()` now returns a NetworkX MultiDiGraph.  That method can also be used to return a weighted graph. 
    The method `weighted_graph` has been removed.
  * Topographic metrics that were part of the WntrMultiDiGraph class are now located in the `wntr.metrics.topographic` module.  

* Added required dependencies to setup.py.  Required and optional dependencies  
  are included in requirements.txt
* Dropped testing for Python 3.5 (matplotlib requires Python >= 3.6)
* Updated documentation
